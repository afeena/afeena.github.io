<p>It was an amazing week in Mexico city at NAACL 2024! I am happy I met so many brilliant researchers and had so many meaningful conversations. I am grateful to be a part of such a community. It‚Äôs a shame I was unable to join all the talks and posters I wanted to attend (sadly cannot be in two places at the same time, I need a time-turner ha-ha). Also, special thanks to Amsterdam folks for keeping me company üòä¬†In this post I want to share my experience and paper highlights.</p>
<p>Before you start, you are more than welcome to read our <a href="https://aclanthology.org/2024.naacl-short.56/">paper</a> so you get more context. Share your ideas and question via e dot tokarchuk at uva dot nl</p>
<p>I‚Äôve presented my work during the first oral session (machine translation track). I was SUPER nervous. When I started I realised they haven‚Äôt used my recent slides (even though I uploaded them a night before as organizers asked.) I recovered quickly cause honestly I have only changed some visuals, content was exactly the same. My hands and legs were shaking. It was ok at the end, however I think I could have done better. My friends told me I looked super calm and nailed it though ‚ù§Ô∏è¬†I got a few questions and they were interesting, I even had a chance to make a teaser for my next paper.</p>
<p>And then I was done and could enjoy the conference at the fullest!</p>
<p>Here is my paper‚Äôs and talks highlights. Note that my highlights are aligned with my specific research interests. It doesn‚Äôt mean they are better than any other papers/talks, I just found them interesting/relevant for my work! Some just had an amazing presentations and I would love to remember some tips for the future.</p>
<h3 id="talks">Talks:</h3>
<p><strong>Harnessing the Power of LLMs to Vitalize Indigenous Languages,</strong> Claudio Santos Pinhanez</p>
<p>NAACL keynote Very nice view on studying indigenous languages from the perspective of the person outside the indigenous community. ‚ÄúNothing about us without us‚Äù. It gave a lot of food for thoughts.</p>
<p><strong>From Insights to Actions: The Role of Analysis Work in NLP</strong>, Marius Mosbach (Keynote Workshop on Insights from Negative Results in NLP)</p>
<p>Interesting analysis of the usage of analysis paper‚Äôs results on NLP works + call for actions</p>
<p><strong>Dual Edges of Innovation: Risks and benefits of LLMS in LMICs</strong> David Restrepo (Keynote, The 6th Clinical Natural Language Processing Workshop)</p>
<p>Talk on how LLMs can be used for clinical data. Main question: can we use one foundation model for every country and every language?</p>
