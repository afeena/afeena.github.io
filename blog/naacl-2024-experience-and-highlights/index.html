<p>It was an amazing week in Mexico city at NAACL 2024! I am happy I met so many brilliant researchers and had so many meaningful conversations. I am grateful to be a part of such a community. It‚Äôs a shame I was unable to join all the talks and posters I wanted to attend (sadly cannot be in two places at the same time, I need a time-turner ha-ha). Also, special thanks to Amsterdam folks for keeping me company üòä¬†In this post I want to share my experience and paper highlights.</p>
<p>Before you start, you are more than welcome to read our <a href="https://aclanthology.org/2024.naacl-short.56/">paper</a> so you get more context. Share your ideas and question via e dot tokarchuk at uva dot nl</p>
<p>I‚Äôve presented my work during the first oral session (machine translation track). I was SUPER nervous. When I started I realised they haven‚Äôt used my recent slides (even though I uploaded them a night before as organizers asked.) I recovered quickly cause honestly I have only changed some visuals, content was exactly the same. My hands and legs were shaking. It was ok at the end, however I think I could have done better. My friends told me I looked super calm and nailed it though ‚ù§Ô∏è¬†I got a few questions and they were interesting, I even had a chance to make a teaser for my next paper.</p>
<p>And then I was done and could enjoy the conference at the fullest!</p>
<p>Here is my paper‚Äôs and talks highlights. Note that my highlights are aligned with my specific research interests. It doesn‚Äôt mean they are better than any other papers/talks, I just found them interesting/relevant for my work! Some just had an amazing presentations and I would love to remember some tips for the future.</p>
<h2 id="talks">Talks:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Harnessing the Power of LLMs to Vitalize Indigenous Languages</strong> Claudio Santos Pinhanez</li>
</ul>
<p>NAACL keynote Very nice view on studying indigenous languages from the perspective of the person outside the indigenous community. ‚ÄúNothing about us without us‚Äù. It gave a lot of food for thoughts.
<img src="naacl-post/keynote-presentation-naacl.jpg" alt="Keynote presentation"></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>From Insights to Actions: The Role of Analysis Work in NLP</strong>, Marius Mosbach (Keynote Workshop on Insights from Negative Results in NLP)</li>
</ul>
<p>Interesting analysis of the usage of analysis paper‚Äôs results on NLP works + call for actions</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dual Edges of Innovation: Risks and benefits of LLMS in LMICs</strong> David Restrepo (Keynote, The 6th Clinical Natural Language Processing Workshop)</li>
</ul>
<p>Talk on how LLMs can be used for clinical data. Main question: can we use one foundation model for every country and every language?</p>
<h2 id="papers-both-oral-and-posters">Papers (both oral and posters):</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>A Preference-driven Paradigm for Enhanced Translation with Large Language Models</strong>¬†Dawei Zhu, Sony Trenous, Xiaoyu Shen, Dietrich Klakow, Bill Byrne, Eva Hasler</li>
</ul>
<p>For some reasons I haven‚Äôt heard about DPO until recent. Interesting approach to overcome plateau in NMT performance while adding fine-tuning data to LLMs.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Direct Preference Optimization for Neural Machine Translation with Minimum Bayes Risk Decoding</strong>¬†Guangyu Yang, Jinghong Chen, Weizhe Lin, Bill Byrne</li>
</ul>
<p>Combination of DPO and MBR in training. Interesting approach to improve translation quality.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>On the True Distribution Approximation of Minimum Bayes-Risk Decoding</strong>¬†Atsumoto Ohashi, Ukyo Honda, Tetsuro Morimura, Yuu Jinnai</li>
</ul>
<p>Analysis work on the true distribution approximation of MBR decoding.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Finding Replicable Human Evaluations via Stable Ranking Probability</strong>¬†Parker Riley, Daniel Deutsch, George Foster, Viresh Ratnakar, Ali Dabirmoghaddam, Markus Freitag</li>
</ul>
<p>How to achieve stable human evaluation results by using different assignments procedures.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>SemRoDe: Macro Adversarial Training to Learn Representations that are Robust to Word-Level Attacks</strong>¬†Brian Formento, Wenjie Feng, Chuan-Sheng Foo, Anh Tuan Luu, See-Kiong Ng</li>
</ul>
<p>Using the robustness term based on distance between the original and adversarial examples in the training objective.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reinforcement Learning for Edit-Based Non-Autoregressive Neural Machine Translation</strong>
Hao Wang, Tetsuro Morimura, Ukyo Honda, Daisuke Kawahara</li>
</ul>
<p>Application of rl for Levenshtein Transformer. Investigation on episodic and sentence level rewards.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Visual Grounding Helps Learn Word Meanings in Low-Data Regimes</strong>
Chengxu Zhuang, Evelina Fedorenko, Jacob Andreas</li>
</ul>
<p>Amazing talk. Even though I am not that much into visual grounding, it was interesting to see how it affects the learning of word meanings. It got best paper award (and I believe it was well-deserved).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>SpeedE: Euclidean Geometric Knowledge Graph Embedding Strikes Back</strong>
Aleksandar Pavloviƒá, Emanuel Sallinger</li>
</ul>
<p>Study on how Euclidean space can be effective for knowledge graph embeddings (comparison with hyperbolic space).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>GPT-who: An Information Density-based Machine-Generated Text Detector</strong>
Saranya Venkatraman, Adaku Uchendu, Dongwon Lee</li>
</ul>
<p>Interesting approach to detect not only machine-generated text, but also identify the model itself.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Retrieving Examples from Memory for Retrieval Augmented Neural Machine Translation: A Systematic Comparison</strong>
Maxime Bouthors, Josep Crego, Fran√ßois Yvon</li>
</ul>
<p>Explore various text-based retrieval metrics (string matching) for retrieval augmented NMT.</p>
<ul>
<li>**Multilingual Machine Translation with Large Language Models: Empirical Results and Analysis
Wenhao Zhu, Hongyi Liu, Qingxiu Dong, Jingjing Xu, Shujian Huang, Lingpeng Kong, Jiajun Chen, Lei Li</li>
</ul>
<p>Exploring the performance of various multilingual LLMs for multilingual NMT.</p>
