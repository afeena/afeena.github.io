      <description>It was an amazing week in Mexico city at NAACL 2024! I am happy I met so many brilliant researchers and had so many meaningful conversations. I am grateful to be a part of such a community. Itâ€™s a shame I was unable to join all the talks and posters I wanted to attend (sadly cannot be in two places at the same time, I need a time-turner ha-ha). Also, special thanks to Amsterdam folks for keeping me company ðŸ˜ŠÂ In this post I want to share my experience and paper highlights.</description>
